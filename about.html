                <h2>Backstory</h2>
                <p>At the start of June 2024 I was involved in a collision where my vehicle had gotten written off. After an anxiety inducing 50 days we received the payout from our insuranace company. With $18k in our bank account it was time to go car shopping. We knew wanted a dual cab ute, as it is an ideal vehicle for my job and also as a family vehicle, but we didn't really care about the make or model. We had been looking for sometime when we came across a 2010 Ford Ranger PK XL, it had good kms for its year, a couple extra features and most importantly fit our budget. We were able to pay for the vehicle, registration transfer, RWC and insurance with the $18k payout.</p>

                    You should probably look at putting some deep cycle batteries with some solar panels - Matty H<br>
                I would put some roof racks on there if I were you - Mike G
